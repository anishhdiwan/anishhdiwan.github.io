I am a robotics engineer and an incoming PhD student at the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) group at TU Darmstadt. I am interested in the fields of robotics, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and decision-making in partially observable and multi-agent settings.

I received my MSc. in Robotics with cum laude honours from TU Delft where I worked on generative imitation learning techniques under the supervision of [Prof. Jens Kober](http://jenskober.de/). In the past, I have held research positions in graph-based ML at the Robert Bosch Center For Data Science & AI at IIT Madras and have also interned in multi-agent coordination at Bosch Research. 

In my spare time, I love photography and music. I also run an [academic blog](https://anishhdiwan.github.io/notes/) where I share archives of my lecture notes, paper summaries, and misc. ideas on robotics/ML.
