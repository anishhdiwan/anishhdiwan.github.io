<h4>MSc. Coursework</h4>

The robotics master program at TU Delft was an extremely fun experience. The program is very focused on practical experience and equipping students with skills applicable to research and industry. I tailored my coursework to focus on the cognitive capabilities of robots and have followed courses on various flavours of machine learning, perception, robot planning, and decision making. Some of my favourite projects are shown below.

<h4>B.Tech Thesis: Quadrupedal Robots & Stability Enhancing Bio-Inspired Systems</h4>

My undergraduate thesis aimed to develop a fully functional, low-cost quadrupedal robot to progress research in the area of legged robot stability enhancement. Subsequent work on this robotic platform was then carried out to study the effect of passively-compliant, bio-inspired feet mechanisms on its static and dynamic walking stability.

<h4>University Rover Challenge</h4>

The University Rover Challenge is an international college-level robotics competition where student teams compete to build the next generation of Mars Rovers. As a part of my universityâ€™s student team (called RoverX), I contributed to the development of the rover and specifically its robotic manipulator.
